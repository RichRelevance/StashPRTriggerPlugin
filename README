Stash Pull Request Trigger Plugin
=================================

This plugin triggers Bamboo builds when pull requests are created or changed from 
Bamboo. This functionality is as important to pull request-based workflows as
the existing automatic branch build functionality is to feature branches workflows.

Native support for this feature has been requests in [this issue](https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/BAM-11205).

Atlassian Plugin information
============================

Here are the SDK commands you'll use immediately:

* atlas-run   -- installs this plugin into the product and starts it on localhost
* atlas-debug -- same as atlas-run, but allows a debugger to attach at port 5005
* atlas-cli   -- after atlas-run or atlas-debug, opens a Maven command line window:
                 - 'pi' reinstalls the plugin into the running product instance
* atlas-help  -- prints description for all commands in the SDK
